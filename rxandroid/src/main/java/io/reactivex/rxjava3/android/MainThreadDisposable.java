/**
 * A {@linkplain Disposable disposable} which ensures its {@linkplain #onDispose()
 * dispose action} is executed on the main thread. When unsubscription occurs on a different
 * thread than the main thread, the action is posted to run on the main thread as soon as possible.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this class are useful in creating observables which interact with APIs that can
 * only be used on the main thread, such as UI objects.
 * <p>
 * A {@link #verifyMainThread() convenience method} is also provided for validating whether code
 * is being called on the main thread. Calls to this method along with instances of this class are
 * commonly used when creating custom observables using the following pattern:
 * <pre><code>
 * &#064;Override public void subscribe(Observer<? extends T> o) {
 *   MainThreadDisposable.verifyMainThread();
 *
 *   // TODO setup behavior
 *
 *    o.onSubscribe(new MainThreadDisposable() {
 *     &#064;Override protected void onDispose() {
 *       // TODO undo behavior
 *     }
 *   });
 * }
 * </code></pre>
