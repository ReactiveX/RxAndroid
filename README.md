# RxAndroid: Reactive Extensions for Android

Android specific bindings for [RxJava 2](http://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).

This module adds the minimum classes to RxJava that make writing reactive components in Android
applications easy and hassle-free. More specifically, it provides a `Scheduler` that schedules on
the main thread or any given `Looper`.


## Communication

Since RxAndroid is part of the RxJava family the communication channels are similar:

# Binaries

```groovy
implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxandroid:2.0.2'
// Because RxAndroid releases are few and far between, it is recommended you also
// explicitly depend on RxJava's latest version for bug fixes and new features.
// (see https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/releases for latest 2.x.x version)
implementation 'io.reactivex.rxjava2:rxjava:2.x.x'
```

# Sample usage

A sample project which provides runnable code examples that demonstrate uses of the classes in this
project is available in the `sample-app/` folder.

## Observing on the main thread

One of the most common operations when dealing with asynchronous tasks on Android is to observe the task's
result or outcome on the main thread. Using vanilla Android, this would typically be accomplished with an
`AsyncTask`. With RxJava instead you would declare your `Observable` to be observed on the main thread:

```java
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
        .subscribe(/* an Observer */);
```

This will execute the `Observable` on a new thread, and emit results through `onNext` on the main thread.

## Observing on arbitrary loopers

The previous sample is merely a specialization of a more general concept: binding asynchronous
communication to an Android message loop, or `Looper`. In order to observe an `Observable` on an arbitrary
`Looper`, create an associated `Scheduler` by calling `AndroidSchedulers.from`:

```java
Looper backgroundLooper = // ...
Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.from(backgroundLooper))
        .subscribe(/* an Observer */)
```

This will execute the Observable on a new thread and emit results through `onNext` on whatever thread is
running `backgroundLooper`.
