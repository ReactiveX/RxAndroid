# RxAndroid: Reactive Extensions for Android

Android specific bindings for [RxJava](http://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava).

This module adds the minimum classes to RxJava that make writing reactive components in Android
applications easy and hassle-free. More specifically, it provides a `Scheduler` that schedules on
the main UI thread or any given `Handler`.


## Communication

Since RxAndroid is part of the RxJava family the communication channels are similar:

- Google Group: [RxJava][list]
- Twitter: [@RxJava][twitter]
- StackOverflow: [rx-android][so]
- [GitHub Issues][issues]


# Binaries

```groovy
compile 'io.reactivex:rxandroid:1.1.0'
// Because RxAndroid releases are few and far between, it is recommended you also
// explicitly depend on RxJava's latest version for bug fixes and new features.
compile 'io.reactivex:rxjava:1.1.0'
```

# Sample usage

A sample project which provides runnable code examples that demonstrate uses of the classes in this
project is available in the `sample-app/` folder.

## Observing on the UI thread

One of the most common operations when dealing with asynchronous tasks on Android is to observe the task's
result or outcome on the main UI thread. Using vanilla Android, this would
typically be accomplished with an `AsyncTask`. With RxJava instead you would declare your `Observable`
to be observed on the main thread:

```java
public class ReactiveFragment extends Fragment {
    @Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
                .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
                .subscribe(/* an Observer */);
    }
```

This will execute the Observable on a new thread, and emit results through `onNext` on the main UI thread.

## Observing on arbitrary threads
The previous sample is merely a specialization of a more general concept, namely binding asynchronous
communication to an Android message loop using the `Handler` class. In order to observe an `Observable`
on an arbitrary thread, create a `Handler` bound to that thread and use the `HandlerScheduler.from`
scheduler:

```java
new Thread(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        Looper.prepare();
        final Handler handler = new Handler(); // bound to this thread
        Observable.just("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
                .subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread())
                .observeOn(HandlerScheduler.from(handler))
                .subscribe(/* an Observer */)

        // perform work, ...
        Looper.loop();
    }
}, "custom-thread-1").start();
```

This will execute the Observable on a new thread and emit results through `onNext` on "custom-thread-1".
(This example is contrived since you could as well call `observeOn(Schedulers.currentThread())` but it
shall suffice to illustrate the idea.)
