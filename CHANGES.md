### Version 2.0.0-RC1 - August 25, 2016 ###

RxAndroid 2.0 has been rewritten from scratch to support RxJava 2.0.

The library still offers the same APIs: a scheduler and stream cancelation callback that know about
the main thread, a means of creating a scheduler from any `Looper`, and plugin support for the
main thread scheduler. They just reside in a new package, `io.reactivex.android`, and may have
slightly different names.
